# 🧠 Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python. The model is trained to classify images of fruits and vegetables into multiple categories using the Fruits-360 dataset. It demonstrates a complete deep learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
